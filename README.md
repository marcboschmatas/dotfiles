Here are my dotfiles for several tools I use in my daily life.

## Nvim
Based on Lazyvim and [R-Nvim](https://github.com/R-nvim/R.nvim).
Largely inspired by Mark Padgham's [dotfiles](https://github.com/mpadge/dotfiles).

## Alacritty
Just a basic configuration to use the same nerd fonts everywhere. Mostly used as a base for tmux.

## LeftWM
My Window Manager. Work in progress based on di-effe's [Amber](https://github.com/di-effe/amber) theme.
